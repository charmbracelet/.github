# Reporting Security Issues

We always aim to ship secure software and take security flaws seriously. Thank
you for responsibly disclosing your findings to the team to keep the open
source community a safe space.

To report a security issue, reach us at vt100@charm.sh. We will be in touch
should we need any additional information or guidance to fix the bug.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.
