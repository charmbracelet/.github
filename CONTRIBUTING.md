# Contributing

**✨ First off, thank you for your support in our mission to make terminals
glamorous! ✨**

Here are some best practices to contribute to Charm ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა

Charm projects are open to contributions. The team is in maintenance mode for
most of our tools right now, so it may take some time to review your
contributions. During this time we will be prioritizing bug fixes. Regardless,
the team always loves to hear from the community and sincerely appreciates all of
your support!

## Features

For new features, please **open a Discussion** prior to creating a pull request. This
allows the team and community to think about the change and provide feedback.
When the maintainers are ready to accept new features, we will look through the
"Ideas" in the project's GitHub Discussions.

## Refactoring

If you are refactoring, please include a brief explanation for the changes and
how it will improve the project.

## Bug Fixes

If you are reporting a bug or creating a pull request, you must include clear
steps to showcase the issue before and after. Tests are preferred, but steps to
reproduce are also appreciated!

## Pull Request Hygiene

Contributions must pass all examples, tests, and CI before merging. For us to
review your PR, we need tests or a minimal, reproducible example[^1] to clearly
showcase all changes.

If any of these are failing and you're struggling to debug the issue, please let
us know in your PR, otherwise we will assume it is a WIP.

Please only mark the pull request as "Ready for Review" when it is in fact
complete and ready for review.

## Code style

If you know this feature exists in another Charm project, please reference that
project's implementation and messaging in your design for consistency across the
org.

For commit messages, please use conventional commits[^2] to make it easier to
generate release notes.
