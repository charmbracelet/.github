# Contributing

**Thanks for giving back to the open source community!**

Here are a few guidelines that make it easier for maintainers to review your
pull requests...

## Contributing changes

For new features, please open an issue prior to creating a pull request. This
allows the team and community to think about the change and provide feedback.

If you are refactoring, please include a brief explanation for the changes and
how it will improve the project.

If you are reporting a bug or creating a pull request, you must include clear
steps to reproduce the issue or highlight the change. Tests are preferred, but
steps to reproduce are also appreciated!

Contributions must pass all examples, tests, and CI before merging. If any of
these are failing and you're struggling to debug the issue, please let us know
in your PR, otherwise we will assume it is a WIP.

## Code style

If you know this feature exists in another Charm project, please reference that
project's implementation and messaging in your design for consistency across the
org.

For commit messages, please use conventional commits[^1] to make it easier to
generate release notes.
