# Support

This document explains where to get help with the Charm ecosystem.

## Help, I'm stuck

Yes, yes, we understand it can be scary (and frustrating) when you get stuck.
Thankfully the beauty of open source is its community. Don't fret young one, we
will hold your hand on the journey to (command-line) enlightenment.

### Discord?

We are incredibly lucky to have a very welcoming and active community. If
you're looking for support from other community members, the
[Discord][https://charm.sh/chat] is the best place to ask. We also have a
community on [Matrix][https://charm.sh/matrix] that has fewer members, but
includes some *very cool* privacy-conscious developers.

The only rule is: ask the question, don't ask "can I ask a question" (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻.

### GitHub

If you're looking for help from a maintainer, please create an issue. A
maintainer may convert your issue to a Discussion once it has been seen to
keep the backlog clean while maintaining visibility of the question. 

Please understand that we are a small team, so it may take some time for us to
get to your question.

## White glove service

If you're a big fan of tutorials. We have a [blog][https://charm.sh/blog] and a
[YouTube channel][https://charm.sh/yt] where we share additional learning
resources. That being said, all of the information you need to get started
should be included in the repository itself. If you find that's not the case and
you see room for improvement, please let us know in the Discord `#feedback`
channel or in an issue (you can tag `@bashbunni`).
